# WebServer
This is my Eco-System webserver which I made for my first year university project. 

It's purpose is to provide environmental information to organisations. 

It's main feature is for users to create and store information they have found about a certain plant or animal which will then be visible for other people to learn and possibly add more to (similar to Wikipedia). 

Designed for positive user experience.
